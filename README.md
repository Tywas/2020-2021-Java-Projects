# Reader-of-Books
Java Project, Reader-of-Books, was created during the 2020-2021 School year

# Overview
This Java application is a GUI that needs a text entry of books to load which will then
present the listed books in the file.  The application allows you to click a book in the file
and it will show the title, author, and the text of the book.

# Compiling and Using
This application will run ReaderOfBooks.Java file with ReaderOfBooksPanel.Java, 
ReaderPanel.java, LibraryPanel.java, BookButton.java, Book.java, and Library.java
all present in the same folder.  Then It will require an input of a csv file 
that is also in the same folder as the ReaderOfBook.Java file. After you will need
an workplace application in order to interact with the GUI (like Eclipse).
